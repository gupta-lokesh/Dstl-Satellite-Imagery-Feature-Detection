# Can you train an eye in the sky? (Image Segmentation) 

Objective: Semantic segmentation of different classes in satellite imagery.   

Models: Built U-net and Seg-Net models to generate masks.     

Results: Using U-net model received Jaccard score  0.3752 on test data and for the Seg-Net test Jaccard score as 0.4463.  

Use-cases: The model can be trained for various image segmentation tasks in satellite imagery, can be used in defense and security systems, creating and keeping up-to-date maps, disaster relief, and improving urban planning.
